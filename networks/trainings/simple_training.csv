# Example of network training file 

# Size of the batches used for the gradient descent
batch_size,250

# Learning rate
lr,0.0025

## Training properties
# kindtraining gives info on how the SNR will be defined in the different tabEpochs
# Int : events for the different epoch will be produced in intervals of SNR
# Scr : events of the given epochs will have the same scalar SNR value
kindTraining,Int

# Lists providing the epochs where we change the training test SNR
# and the SNR values
# Here for example, we are in Int mode, so from epochs 0 to 1, SNR will be 
# randomly distributed between 16 and 32. From epochs 2 to 8 it will be between
# 12 and 24, and so on...
tabEpochs,2,10,30,100

# Below is an example of scalar SNR training, the 2 tables have the same length

# Name of the training/testing samples files
# It will be checked but they have to contain the same
