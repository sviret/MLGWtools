# The type of noise sensitivity

# if choosing the last one you should provide a text file containing
# the profile
kindPSD,analytic,

# Within which frequency range the noise will be produced
# keep in mind that fmax should be <f2/2 (Nyquist cut)
# for realistic profile you need usually fmin>10Hz

# Whitened data (1) or not (0) 
# if 1 the data will be whitened in the frequency domain using the PSD provided
# if 0 you will get the raw data unwhitened
# if 2 you will get whitened data from a zero-latency FIR filter in the time domain (experimental)
